The provided Terraform configuration sets up three AWS providers in different regions (eu-west-1, eu-west-2, eu-west-3) using provider aliases. It then creates three EC2 instances (ins-1, ins-2, ins-3), each associated with a specific provider based on the region. Each instance is configured with a t2.micro instance type and a specific AMI ID corresponding to the respective region.
